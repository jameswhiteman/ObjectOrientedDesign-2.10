Chapter 2, exercise 10:

I would say that a superclass would be inappropriate in this case.
True, a superclass would eliminate the need for the "name" property
to be replicated across classes, but the only layer of abstraction
that the classes have in common is a "Noun". Unless a much broader
variety of nouns were to be introduced into the program beyond the
ones listed, it would only complicate the design of the program. If
a huge list of nouns were to be introduced, perhaps in some sort
of dictionary application, then a Noun superclass could be in
order, in which case it should be abstract. It is appropriate
to have superclasses when classes share multiple similarities,
the addition of a superclass would not needlessly complicate the
program, and the amount of code reuse gained from it were at least
somewhat significant.
